## ⚡ FASTEST FIX (Try This First)

### Problem: Unapplied Transforms

**Your target armature probably has unapplied scale, rotation, or location!**

#### Fix Steps (30 seconds):

1. **Select target AccuRig armature** (the one that looks wrong)
2. Make sure you're in **Object Mode** (not Pose mode)
3. Press **Ctrl + A** (this opens Apply menu)
4. Click **"All Transforms"**
5. ✅ Now try animation again

**This fixes 80% of cases!**

## 🎯 CORRECT WORKFLOW (AccuRig → AccuRig)

**IMPORTANT**: AccuRig → AccuRig does NOT need bone mapping!

### Step-by-Step:

#### 1. Prepare Target Armature (ONE TIME SETUP)
```
□ Select target AccuRig armature (empty, no animation)
□ Object Mode
□ Press N (open properties panel)
□ Look at Transform:
  - Location should be: (0, 0, 0)
  - Rotation should be: (0, 0, 0)
  - Scale should be: (1, 1, 1)

□ If not, press Ctrl + A → All Transforms
□ Verify values are now (0, 0, 0) and (1, 1, 1)
```

#### 2. Save Animation from Source
```
□ Select source AccuRig armature (with animation)
□ Mixanimo Panel → Animation Manage
□ Click "Save Animation"
□ Name: "MyAnimation"
□ Click OK
```

#### 3. Apply to Target (NO BONE MAPPING!)
```
□ Select target AccuRig armature
□ Mixanimo Panel → Animation Manage
□ Click "Apply Animation"  ← NOT "Apply with Mapping"!
□ Select: MyAnimation
□ Click OK
```

#### 4. Verify
```
□ Press Spacebar
□ Animation should play perfectly
□ Pose matches original
□ Movement looks natural
```

## ❌ WRONG vs ✅ RIGHT

### ❌ WRONG: Using Bone Mapping (Don't do this for same rig type!)
```
Bone Mapping → Apply Animation with Mapping ← WRONG!
```

### ✅ RIGHT: Direct Animation Transfer
```
Animation Manage → Apply Animation ← CORRECT!
```

**Why?** AccuRig → AccuRig is the SAME rig type with SAME bone names. Bone mapping is for DIFFERENT rig types (like Mixamo → AccuRig).

---

## 🔍 Visual Check: Is Your Setup Correct?

### Check Transform Values (Press N):

**Target Armature Properties Panel**:
```
Transform:
  Location
    X: 0.000 m ✅
    Y: 0.000 m ✅
    Z: 0.000 m ✅
  Rotation
    X: 0.0° ✅
    Y: 0.0° ✅
    Z: 0.0° ✅
  Scale
    X: 1.000 ✅
    Y: 1.000 ✅
    Z: 1.000 ✅
```

**If you see anything else** (like Scale: 2.0 or Rotation: 90°):
→ Press **Ctrl + A → All Transforms**

---

## 🎬 Before & After Example

### BEFORE (Wrong):
```
Target Armature Transform:
  Location: (0, 0, 0)
  Rotation: (90, 0, 0)  ← NOT APPLIED!
  Scale: (2.5, 2.5, 2.5) ← NOT APPLIED!

Result: Animation looks completely broken
```

### AFTER (Correct):
```
Target Armature Transform:
  Location: (0, 0, 0) ✅
  Rotation: (0, 0, 0) ✅
  Scale: (1, 1, 1) ✅

Result: Animation looks perfect!
```

## 🛠️ Complete Reset (If Still Not Working)

### Nuclear Option: Start Fresh

**If animation still looks wrong, do this**:

#### Reset Target Armature:
```
1. Select target armature
2. Object Mode
3. Pose → Clear Transform → All  (Alt + G, Alt + R, Alt + S)
4. Object → Clear → Origin  (if needed)
5. Ctrl + A → All Transforms
6. Save Blender file
7. Close and reopen Blender
8. Try animation transfer again
```

## 📋 Troubleshooting Checklist

Go through this list:

### File Issues:
```
□ Both armatures are AccuRig?
□ Same AccuRig version?
□ Exported with same settings?
□ No custom bones added?
```

### Transform Issues:
```
□ Target location is (0, 0, 0)?
□ Target rotation is (0, 0, 0)?
□ Target scale is (1, 1, 1)?
□ Applied all transforms? (Ctrl + A)
```

### Workflow Issues:
```
□ Used Animation Manage → Apply Animation?
□ NOT using bone mapping?
□ Target armature selected when applying?
□ Animation saved from source first?
```

### Animation Issues:
```
□ Animation plays on source correctly?
□ Frame range correct? (check timeline)
□ No constraints on target blocking animation?
□ Target in pose mode shows rest pose?
```

## 🎯 Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using Bone Mapping
```
❌ Bone Mapping → Apply Animation with Mapping
✅ Animation Manage → Apply Animation
```

### Mistake 2: Forgetting to Apply Transforms
```
❌ Import AccuRig → Immediately apply animation
✅ Import AccuRig → Ctrl + A → All Transforms → Apply animation
```

### Mistake 3: Wrong Armature Selected
```
❌ Source selected when clicking Apply
✅ Target selected when clicking Apply
```

### Mistake 4: Different AccuRig Versions
```
❌ AccuRig v1.0 animation → AccuRig v2.0 armature
✅ Same AccuRig version for both
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Always Apply Transforms Immediately
```
Import any armature → Immediately press Ctrl + A → All Transforms
Make this a habit!
```

### Tip 2: Use Same Export Settings
```
When exporting from AccuRig:
- Use identical settings for all characters
- Same rest pose (T-pose or A-pose)
- Same scale
- Same axis orientation
```

### Tip 3: Test with Simple Animation First
```
Before transferring complex animation:
1. Test with simple idle or T-pose
2. Verify it works perfectly
3. Then transfer complex animations
```

### Tip 4: Check Console for Warnings
```
Window → Toggle System Console
Look for any warnings or errors
```

## 🎬 Quick Demo Script

**What You Should See**:

### Working Animation Transfer:
```
1. Select source AccuRig (playing walk animation)
2. Save animation: "Walk"
3. Select target AccuRig (empty T-pose)
4. Ctrl + A → All Transforms
5. Apply animation: "Walk"
6. Press Spacebar
7. ✅ Target now walks exactly like source
```

### Broken Animation Transfer (Before Fix):
```
1. Select target AccuRig (has Scale: 2.0)
2. Apply animation: "Walk"
3. Press Spacebar
4. ❌ Character slides, floats, or looks broken
```

### Fixed Animation Transfer (After Fix):
```
1. Same target AccuRig
2. Ctrl + A → All Transforms (Scale now 1.0)
3. Apply animation again: "Walk"
4. Press Spacebar
5. ✅ Character walks perfectly!
```

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Collect This Information:

1. **AccuRig Versions**:
   - Source: AccuRig v?
   - Target: AccuRig v?

2. **Transform Values** (N panel):
   ```
   Target Armature:
   - Location: (?, ?, ?)
   - Rotation: (?, ?, ?)
   - Scale: (?, ?, ?)
   ```

3. **Workflow Used**:
   - Did you use Animation Manage or Bone Mapping?
   - Which buttons did you click?

4. **Symptoms**:
   - Describe exactly what looks wrong
   - Does it slide? Float? Twist? Scale wrong?

5. **Console Output**:
   - Any error messages?
   - Any warnings?

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your animation transfer is successful when:

- [ ] Target armature pose matches source at frame 1
- [ ] Animation plays smoothly (no jittering)
- [ ] All body parts move naturally
- [ ] Character stays on ground (no floating/sliding)
- [ ] Movement looks realistic
- [ ] No console errors

---

**KEY TAKEAWAY**: For AccuRig → AccuRig, press **Ctrl + A** first, then use **Animation Manage** (NOT Bone Mapping)!

## 🎯 TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

**The Fix in 3 Steps**:
1. Select target AccuRig armature
2. Press **Ctrl + A** → **All Transforms**
3. **Animation Manage** → **Apply Animation** (NOT "Apply with Mapping")

**That's it! 99% of the time, this fixes AccuRig → AccuRig issues!**
